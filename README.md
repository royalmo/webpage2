# Webpage 2

A cringeless and simple webpage to introduce myself and my work. There's a 2
at the end of the name because the first version had a lot of cringe in it,
it was done using bootstrap studio.

This is a static no-build website using [simple.css](https://simplecss.org/).
Hosted at htz.ericroy.net using a simple nginx setup.
